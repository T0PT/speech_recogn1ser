So, this is a small program I made for my mum.
She needed to transcribe a lot of text from video and do it locally, so here it is.
It uses whisper from OpenAI as a working model, you can also choose the appropriate size for you.
Right now it works with mkv, wav, mp3 and flec, I didn't spend lots of time on it yet, so don't judge too hard :)

You can download and give it a shot, here is a small instruction on how to do that:
1. You have to have python installed, I guess every version from 3.8 should work.
2. You have to have Chocolatey installed.
3. Clone this repository to your machine.
4. Run setup.bat as an admin(for chocolatey) - it will download and install all neccessary dependencies. You have to do this step only once.
5. After that you can just run start.bat and you have it going
